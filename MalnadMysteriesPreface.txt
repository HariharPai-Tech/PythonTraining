The Malnad region is a natural wonder that must be seen to be believed. It is distinguished by its warm and welcoming people and its magnificent natural beauty. Every town in this region has different stories.
I've assembled a collection of 17 such mysterious tales for your reading pleasure in this book.
I've had personal experience with these stories or heard them from other folks.
The gods, the demigods, the rituals, the innocence and the science all are part of the stories.
People pass away, but the stories live on. I didn't want these stories to perish with me, so I wrote them down. These are the one-of-a-kind stories about the place, the real people who lived there, and their narrations. To protect their privacy, I've changed the names of a select few people.
Some of the tales remain shrouded in secrecy. It's possible that if you come from one of these regions, some of these tales were passed down to you by your ancestors. If you have any information, please get in touch with the author.
Whenever feasible, I've tried to provide actual photos of the individuals and locations featured in the stories.
Fourteen of these stories take place in the Malnad region. The remaining three stories are from Bangalore, Tuticorin, and Goa. Each one is more mysterious than the other. Enjoy reading.
I would like to know the feedback of the readers. And also if they could solve any of the mysteries.I would like to know the feedback of the readers. And also if they could solve any of the mysteries.
